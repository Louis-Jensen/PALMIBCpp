R-code implementation of estimation, simulation, and more. Associated paper is "Semiparametric point process modeling of blinking artifacts in PALM", to appear in The Annals of Applied Statistics.

The 'Examples of use.R' file goes over setup and some common operations, including estimation, computation of derived statistics, simulation, and blinking corrected CSR testing.
