# PALMIBCpp
Code for simulation, estimation, and more in the PALM-IBCpp model. The PALM-IBCpp models data from photoactivated localization microscopy, with a focus on blinking artifacts.

R-code implementation of estimation, simulation, and more, associated with the paper "Semiparametric point process modelling of blinking artifacts in PALM".

The 'Examples of use.R' file goes over setup and some common operations, including estimation, computation of derived statistics, simulation, and blinking corrected CSR testing.
